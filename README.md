This is an [AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) script that allows Greek 
letters to be entered on a Latin keyboard by typing the corresponding 
[Beta Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Code) then pressing the `~` key. 
It works in any application. 

### Instructions

Type a Beta Code then press the `~` key.

For example, the expression

	y = αx + β

can be entered as:

	y = a~x + b~
